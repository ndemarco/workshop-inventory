## 🎯 What This System Does

### Current Features (v1.1.0)
✅ **Organize thousands of items** in hierarchical storage  
✅ **Web interface** with expandable modules and inline grids  
✅ **Search functionality** to find items quickly  
✅ **Location management** with row/column addressing  
✅ **Docker deployment** - one command to run  

### Example Use Case (Your Requirement!)
```
Module: "Muse" (your fastener cabinet)
└── Level 4: Drawer 4
    ├── A1: #6 pan head screws
    ├── A2: #8 pan head screws ← 
    │       "pan head phillips, 3/4 inch long, 
    │        #8 mild steel"
    └── A3: #10 pan head screws

When you add: System checks for duplicates
              Suggests similar items if found
              Prevents storing same thing twice
```

### Coming Soon (Documented & Planned)
🚧 **AI Semantic Search** - "find long metric bolt M6"  
🚧 **Duplicate Detection** - Warns about similar items  
🚧 **CLI Tool** - `invctl search "M6 bolts"`  
🚧 **Voice Interface** - "Hey Inventory, where are my M6 bolts?"

## 🔍 Understanding the Hex Files

You asked about the hex-digit named files in your original zip. Those were **Git internal objects** from an incomplete git repository extraction. 

**The clean version (this package) has:**
- ✅ Proper `.git/` directory structure
- ✅ Complete commit history (7 commits)
- ✅ Clean, pushable repository
- ✅ No loose object files in wrong places

You can verify:
```bash
cd inventory-system-clean
git log --oneline  # Shows 7 clean commits
```

---
