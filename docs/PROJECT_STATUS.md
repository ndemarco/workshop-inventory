## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.11+
- Flask 3.0
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- PostgreSQL 14+
- psycopg2

**Frontend:**
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Alpine.js 3.x (15KB)
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Responsive design

**Deployment:**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Nginx (reverse proxy)
- Alpine Linux (base images)

**Future Technologies:**
- Sentence Transformers (Phase 4)
- spaCy (Phase 3-4)
- Click framework (Phase 5)
- Vosk/Whisper STT (Phase 6)
- Redis (caching, Phase 4+)

### Database Schema

```
Module (1) ──< (many) Level (1) ──< (many) Location (1) ──< (many) Item
                                                                     │

```

**Key Design Decision**: One item per location (simplified from many-to-many)

### API Structure

```
/api/
├── /items          - Item CRUD operations
├── /modules        - Module management
├── /levels         - Level management  
├── /locations      - Location management
└── /search         - Search functionality
```
